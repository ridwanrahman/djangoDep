# Description 
A reusable Django starter project with a clean base (main), and each branch representing a trial feature (e.g. Celery setup, DRF config, Auth0 integration, etc.), which can be cherry-picked or merged into other projects.

# Description of this branch
This branch is a minimal Django project setup.
I have created the django project inside a src folder which is a common practice to keep the project files organized.
